# PySpark_data_Analysis-Visualization

In this project we were requested to perform data analysis on csv files with milions of rows (about 16 M). For this we have used Apache Spark distributed computing framework together with the python API PySpark.

I reccomend to download the ipynb file and open it in Vs Code. 

For space reasons I didn't upload the csv files. You should still be able to see the outputs (some of them could be missing such as charts). Every step instruction and solution is presented. If you want to ask me more in detail what I've done contact me at tommaso.verzegnassi@gmail.com.
